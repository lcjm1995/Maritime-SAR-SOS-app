            <p>Welcome to the Beach Buddy application.</p> <br>
            <p>This application has been created with the purpose of providing you with any information you may be interested to know when you plan to visit one of the UK's scenic beaches.</p><br>
            <p>You can look up all of the information you may require on the Beach Buddy page on this website.</p><br>
            <p>You may notice the Big Red SOS button that is located in the main menu of this website. If you ever find yourself in an emergency you can click this button and the local search and rescue services will be provided with your current location and some of your details (your name, DOB, Emergency Contact name and number). If there are no lifeguards located nearby you will be directed to the national service.</p><br>
            <p>Please do not misuse this button, and always make sure you check the local weather before visiting the beach.</p><br>
            <p>"Need a lifeguard, press the SOS button hard!"</p>
